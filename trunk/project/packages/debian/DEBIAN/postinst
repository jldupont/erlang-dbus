	Policy 10.7.3
	
		A common practice is to create a script called package-configure and have the package's postinst call it 
		if and only if the configuration file does not already exist. 
		In certain cases it is useful for there to be an example or template file which the maintainer scripts use. 
		Such files should be in /usr/share/package or /usr/lib/package (depending on whether they are architecture-independent or not). 
		There should be symbolic links to them from /usr/share/doc/package/examples if they are examples, 
		and should be perfectly ordinary dpkg-handled files (not configuration files).
